# 🛍️ Retail Demand Forecasting Project  
**Data-Driven Inventory Optimization for Retail Sub-Categories**

This project builds and evaluates time-series forecasting models to predict retail demand across product sub-categories. By forecasting at a granular level rather than category-wide, we uncover unique seasonal patterns, growth trends, and operational insights useful for inventory planning and promotion strategy.
